# update in a tmux window
Updating via SSH, auto open a tmux window and start updating...
I created an alias in `.bash_aliases`... I put my scripts in home/dave/scripts (I'm Dave!)
```bash
alias u='$HOME/scripts/update.sh'
```
### Requires tmux - https://github.com/tmux/
```
sudo apt install tmux
```
I can't, well yeah I can, believe I forgot the variable! Also, I had the IFs backward... ugh.
